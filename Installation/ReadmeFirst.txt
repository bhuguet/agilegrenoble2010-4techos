First, insall jdk, maven and ensure they work properly
(you can use some commented line present in install.bat)

Assumption :
Download the whole project into a working directory, as example : e:\build\workspace 

run install.bat, it will :
  * install maven dependency on your pc
  * copy dependency in the target dir of each project for eclipse

Start eclipse and use your working directory as workspace, use "import existing project" to populate eclipse.

Note : currently you need to install mysql too.
